# Improvements

Ranked backlog for `analytics-service-toolkit` (`astk`) after v1 scaffolding. Items are ordered by how much they increase the odds this library actually gets adopted by the KINZ services and stays correct — not by effort. Work top-down; each item is self-contained and has explicit acceptance criteria.

Current state at time of writing: 74 passed / 2 skipped, 92% coverage, ruff-clean, CI green, install-from-git only (updated 2026-10-02 after item 5a landed; the "60 passed / 1 skipped" figure predated it).

~~zero real consumers~~ — **correction (2026-09-04, see item 3's verification below):**
`kinz-margin-guardian-pipeline` already imports `astk.settings`, `astk.db`, and `astk.alerts`
in production code (not just a demo). This wasn't tracked here because the adoption happened
in that repo's own cycles, not through this backlog. Item 1 below still describes a real,
unfinished goal (a *documented, intentional* first-consumer integration with CI proving the
install-from-git path) but the "zero consumers" framing that motivated ranking it #1 is no
longer accurate — treat item 1 as "prove the packaging/CI story," not "get any consumer at
all."

**Progress (2026-09-04):** item 3 done (see below — `docs/ADOPTION.md` verified against real
source of all four KINZ repos). Item 2 was done 2026-08-27. Item 1 status has changed since it
was last looked at:
- `kinz-price-bridge` is **no longer empty** — it now has real content (`src/`, `tests/`,
  `docs/`, `Dockerfile`, `CLAUDE.md`, `pyproject.toml`, pushed 2026-09-02), so the "orphaned
  empty repo" blocker that justified marking item 1 blocked-on-genesis may no longer hold.
  **However, it does not import or depend on `astk` at all** (`grep -rn astk` across its
  `pyproject.toml` and `src/` is empty) — so item 1's acceptance criteria are still unmet
  there. Making `kinz-price-bridge` actually consume `astk` requires editing *that* repo, which
  is out of scope for an astk-repo cycle and wasn't this cycle's selected work — flagging for
  the owner/next cycle rather than doing it here. See `NEEDS YOUR DECISION` in this cycle's
  loop report.
- Given `kinz-margin-guardian-pipeline` is now a real (partial) consumer, item 1's own
  "why first" framing is weaker than when it was written — consider re-ranking it below item 4
  (version contract) on a future pass, since an unpinned real consumer now exists and that's
  arguably more urgent than adding a second one.

**Update 2026-09-23:** item 4's code/docs half is done (now 4a, below). The
only thing left under "4" is 4b — tagging `v0.1.0` and cutting the release —
which is a publish action for the owner, not something this loop takes on
its own authority. Next independently-actionable item for *this* repo is
therefore **5** (Postgres-backed `Deduplicator`), unless the owner does 4b
first and wants the README pin as a follow-up.

**Update 2026-10-02:** item 5's library-code half is done (now 5a, below).
The remaining piece — wiring a real Postgres service container into CI so
5a's concurrency test actually runs somewhere — is split out as 5b, since it
edits an existing CI workflow file (a separate, owner-reviewed change under
this loop's merge rules) and can't be verified from a sandbox with no
Postgres instance. Next independently-actionable items for *this* repo are
therefore **6** (`astk doctor` schema checks) or **7** (repo hygiene), unless
the owner does 4b or 5b first.

## 1. Prove `astk` works inside a real consuming repo (`kinz-price-bridge`)

**What to do.** `kinz-price-bridge` is a sibling repo in the portfolio that is currently empty. Scaffold it as the first real consumer of `astk` — greenfield, so no existing repo needs to be opened or edited:

- `pyproject.toml` depending on `astk` via a pinned git ref (see item 4), not a local path and not `-e ../`.
- A `Settings(BaseServiceSettings)` subclass that adds two or three bridge-specific fields, loaded via `load_settings()`.
- One real code path that uses `make_engine()` + `session_scope()` + `fetch_df()` against a SQLite dev DB, one that sends a `SlackNotifier` alert through a `Deduplicator`, and `configure_logging()` at entrypoint.
- A one-page Streamlit view built from `astk.dashboard` chrome (`page_header`, `kpi_row`, `timeseries`, `cached_query`).
- CI that runs `pip install` of `astk` from git in a clean environment and executes `astk doctor` as a build step.

**Acceptance:** `kinz-price-bridge` has no hand-rolled engine creation, no direct `requests.post` to a Slack webhook, and no `logging.basicConfig` anywhere. Every point of friction hit during the integration gets filed back here as a new item, and any API awkwardness gets fixed in `astk` rather than worked around in the consumer.

**Why first.** The entire justification for this repo is that it is a connective piece between four services, and right now that claim rests on nothing but the library's own test suite and a demo app that was written by the same author, in the same repo, against seeded in-memory SQLite. A library that has never been imported across a package boundary has not been tested — install surface, dependency resolution, optional-extras behavior, and import ergonomics are all unverified. Every other item on this list is cheaper and more accurate to do *after* one real consumer exists, because the consumer will tell you which gaps are real. This is also the highest-value item for the portfolio story: "extracted a shared library" and "a service actually depends on it" are very different claims.

## 2. ~~Verify and fix `dashboard.cached_query()` — suspected broken caching~~ ✅

**Done 2026-08-27 (closed loop, laptop).**

**Verified — the "cache never hits" hypothesis was wrong.** `st.cache_data` keys its
namespace on the wrapped function's `__module__` + `__qualname__` + source hash, all of
which are stable across a re-created closure, so repeated identical calls *did* hit the
cache. `test_cached_query_reuses_the_cache_on_a_repeated_identical_call` pins this and
passes against the pre-fix code too.

**But there was a real, silent correctness bug:** `engine` was captured in the per-call
closure — *outside* the `st.cache_data` key — so a second engine pointed at a different
database silently received the first engine's rows
(`test_cached_query_does_not_serve_one_engines_rows_to_another`: `assert 1 == 2` against
old code). `cached_query` also had no `params` argument at all, so parameterised queries
couldn't be cached correctly.

**Fix.** Single module-level `_cached_fetch_df(_engine, url, sql, params)` decorated once
with `@st.cache_data`. Public signature is now `cached_query(engine, sql, params=None)` —
keyed on `(str(engine.url), sql, sorted(params))`, all hashable; `_engine` rides along
under a leading-underscore name so Streamlit skips it in the hash. `ttl` is now the module
constant `CACHED_QUERY_TTL_S` (60s, unchanged default) because `st.cache_data` only takes
`ttl` at decoration time — see the docstring.

**Breaking change** (acceptable — zero consumers, function was unused even by the demo):
the third positional arg went from `ttl_s: int` to `params: dict | None`. Fold this into
item 4's `CHANGELOG.md` `0.1.0`/Unreleased entry when that lands.

Tests: `tests/test_dashboard.py` +4 (40 passed / 1 skipped, 91% coverage, was 89%).
`streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest` was not needed — the bare-mode cache with a monkeypatched
`fetch_df` counter reproduces rerun behaviour faithfully.

---

## 3. ~~Verify `docs/ADOPTION.md` against the actual source of the four KINZ repos~~ ✅

**Done 2026-09-04 (closed loop, laptop).**

Grepped all four repos (`create_engine(`, `sessionmaker`, `hooks.slack.com`,
`requests.post`, `logging.basicConfig`, `st.set_page_config`, `BaseSettings`,
`os.environ[`) via fresh shallow clones and read the relevant source directly
rather than trusting file layout alone. Full per-repo tables with
`path/to/file.py:LINE` evidence and a Blocker column are now in
`docs/ADOPTION.md`. Headline findings, most important first:

- **The doc's core premise was wrong.** `kinz-margin-guardian-pipeline`
  already imports `astk.settings`, `astk.db`, and `astk.alerts` in production
  code — this is a real consumer today, not a hypothetical one. Its Dashboard
  concern is the one row still genuinely unadopted, and it's now an
  inconsistency bug, not a clean slate: `dashboard/app.py` hand-rolls
  `create_engine(DATABASE_URL)` directly instead of reusing the `astk.db.make_engine`
  its own `api/database.py` already imports two files over.
- **One `UNVERIFIED` claim was actually a real, previously-undocumented
  blocker.** `kinz-competitor-intelligence` sets `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` +
  `busy_timeout=30000` on every pooled SQLite connection so the scraper can
  write while the dashboard reads. `astk.db.make_engine` has no equivalent
  handling for file-backed SQLite (only `:memory:` gets special-cased). This
  matches the standing loop-engine registry note not to migrate this repo's
  DB layer to `astk.db` — now backed by a specific line-level citation instead
  of a general warning.
  **Resolved:** `make_engine()` now applies the same `journal_mode=WAL` +
  `busy_timeout=30000` to every SQLite connection it opens (file-backed or
  `:memory:`, via a `connect`-event listener — see `src/astk/db.py`,
  `tests/test_db.py`), so this is no longer a reason to keep
  `kinz-competitor-intelligence`'s engine off `astk.db`. It deliberately still
  does not create a missing parent directory or eagerly open a connection —
  `make_engine()` stays lazy and non-throwing even for an unreachable path;
  that's each consuming service's own responsibility, same as before.
- **`kinz-secure-commerce-hub` had an undocumented blocker too.** Its own
  settings class fails fast on known-insecure default secrets in production;
  `astk.settings.BaseServiceSettings` has no equivalent check. Adopting it
  as-is would be a silent security regression, not a lateral move. Also: the
  "nightly reconciliation job" and "alerting it grows" language in the
  original doc described something that doesn't exist in the repo yet —
  corrected to reflect that.
- **`kinz-accounting-analysis-*`'s DB row was already correctly absent** — no
  SQL database exists in that repo at all (file-based CSV/Parquet outputs
  only), confirmed rather than assumed this time.

No line-count deletions were estimated — the acceptance criteria asked for
them, but with three of four repos returning "not adopted, real blocker" or
"doesn't exist yet," a deletion estimate would have been speculative for rows
that don't have a clean before/after yet. Worth doing once item 1 (or the
`kinz-margin-guardian-pipeline` dashboard fix above) produces a second real
diff to measure from.

---

## 4a. Version-contract groundwork: `CHANGELOG.md` + metadata-driven `__version__` + Compatibility docs ✅

**Done 2026-09-23 (closed loop, laptop).**

Split out of the original item 4 (now 4b, below) — cutting a tag and a
GitHub release on a public repo is a publish action outside what an
unattended loop cycle takes on its own judgement; the file/code changes are
not, so they landed here instead of being blocked on the whole item.

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format: `Unreleased` section plus
  a `0.1.0` entry listing the initial module set (settings, db, alerts,
  dashboard, logging, CLI) and the two correctness fixes items 2 and 3 already
  landed, including the `cached_query()` breaking-change note item 2 asked to
  fold in here.
- `astk.__version__` now reads from
  `importlib.metadata.version("analytics-service-toolkit")` — the pip
  distribution name, not the `astk` import name; the two differ, and getting
  this wrong (verified by deliberately reintroducing it, see below) silently
  falls back to the hardcoded literal with no visible error — instead of a
  hardcoded string literal, falling back to the `pyproject.toml` literal only
  when metadata isn't available (editable/uninstalled case,
  `PackageNotFoundError`). `astk version` (the CLI command) was already wired
  to print `__version__` — unchanged, now correct by construction instead of
  two numbers kept in sync by hand.
- `tests/test_version.py`: one test asserts `astk.__version__` equals
  `pyproject.toml`'s version; a second monkeypatches
  `importlib.metadata.version` and reloads the module to pin the *exact*
  distribution name queried and prove the value actually flows from
  metadata, not a coincidentally-equal fallback (the first test alone can't
  tell those apart, since both are currently `"0.1.0"` — confirmed by
  reintroducing the wrong-name bug and watching only the second test fail);
  a third exercises `astk version` end-to-end via the CLI runner.
- Added a "Compatibility" section to `README.md` stating the pre-1.0 policy:
  minor bumps may break, patch bumps never do.

Tests: `tests/test_version.py` +3 (60 passed / 1 skipped, was 57 passed / 1
skipped — coverage unaffected, the new tests are metadata-only, no new source
lines to cover). The backlog's "current state" line at the top of this file
(36 passed) had already gone stale from items 2/3 landing since it was
written; corrected there too rather than compounding it further.

## 4b. Tag `v0.1.0`, cut the GitHub release, and pin the README install line

**What to do.** Now that 4a exists, this is the remaining, purely-owner action:

- Tag `v0.1.0` at the commit that merges 4a and cut a GitHub release pointing
  at the `CHANGELOG.md` `0.1.0` entry.
- Update the README install section from the current bare git URL to a pinned
  form: `pip install "astk @ git+https://github.com/nassim0014/analytics-service-toolkit.git@v0.1.0"`,
  with a note that consumers must pin a tag, never a branch. (Left undone in
  4a deliberately — documenting a tag that doesn't exist yet would be
  misleading; do this in the same commit as the tag.)

**Why left for the owner.** Cutting a release makes a new artifact visible on
a public repo's Releases tab — that's a publish action, not a code change,
and outside what this loop takes on its own authority.

**Why fourth (original ranking, still applies to 4b).** Four services
depending on an unpinned default branch is a supply chain where any commit to
`main` can break production in repos nobody was thinking about. Pinning is
the precondition for item 1's CI to be meaningful and for anyone to adopt the
library without fear.

---

## 5a. Multi-process `Deduplicator` with a Postgres-backed backend ✅

**Done 2026-10-02 (cloud-improvements loop).**

Split out of the original item 5 below (now 5b) — the library code (protocol,
backend, table DDL, tests against fakes/sqlite) is independently shippable
without touching CI, while wiring a real Postgres service container into
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is a separate, CI-file-editing change this cycle's
merge rules don't allow in the same PR (no existing workflow file may be
modified) and that can't be verified here anyway — there is no Postgres
instance in this environment.

- `DedupBackend` is now a `Protocol` in `src/astk/alerts.py` with one atomic
  method, `claim(key: str, ttl: timedelta) -> bool`.
- `InMemoryDedupBackend` is the existing per-process logic, extracted
  unchanged in behaviour. `Deduplicator(ttl_s=...)` still works exactly as
  before (back-compat verified — `tests/test_alerts.py`'s three original
  Deduplicator tests pass unmodified) and now also takes an optional
  `backend=` kwarg.
- `PostgresDedupBackend(engine, table_name="astk_alert_dedup")` issues the
  single atomic upsert from the original spec
  (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE SET expires_at = :exp WHERE
  <table>.expires_at < now() RETURNING key`) — a returned row means the
  claim was won. Table name is validated against a safe-identifier regex
  before being interpolated into the SQL (identifiers can't be bind
  parameters).
- `create_dedup_table(engine, table_name=...)` does the idempotent
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, with the raw DDL also in its docstring for
  consumers who'd rather paste it into their own migrations.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_dedup_backends.py`, +15, 2 skipped total including
  the pre-existing streamlit skip): full behavioural coverage of
  `InMemoryDedupBackend` and of `Deduplicator`'s delegation to an injected
  backend; the Postgres SQL-building path is verified against a fake
  engine/connection (asserts the statement text contains the atomic
  upsert's `ON CONFLICT`/`RETURNING`/`WHERE ... < now()` clauses and the
  right bind params, and that it's exactly one `execute()` call, not a
  select-then-write) rather than against real Postgres, which isn't
  available here. Verified these tests actually catch a regression: with
  `src/astk/alerts.py` reverted to the pre-change code, the whole module
  fails to import (`ImportError: cannot import name 'InMemoryDedupBackend'`)
  — ruled out these being tests that would pass against anything.
- A `@pytest.mark.postgres` concurrency test (two threads racing
  `backend.claim()` on the same key must produce exactly one `True`) is
  written but skipped unless `ASTK_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` is set — it has never
  actually run, here or in CI. The `postgres` marker is now registered in
  `pyproject.toml` so pytest doesn't warn about it.

**Remaining work is 5b below** — wiring a Postgres service container into CI
so the concurrency test actually runs somewhere, which is an owner call on
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (a separate PR, reviewed on its own, per the
merge rules this loop runs under).

---

## 5b. Wire a real Postgres service container into CI for the dedup concurrency test

**What to do.** `tests/test_dedup_backends.py::test_postgres_backend_two_racing_claims_produce_exactly_one_winner`
(from 5a) exists but is always skipped — nothing has ever run it, including
this library's own CI. Add a `postgres` service container to
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or a separate job) and set
`ASTK_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` so that test executes for real, plus install the
`postgres` extra (`psycopg2-binary`) in that job so the driver is present.

**Why left for a future cycle, not bundled into 5a.** It's an edit to an
*existing* CI workflow file, which this loop's merge rules treat as
high-enough-stakes to require its own reviewed PR rather than riding along
with a library-code change — and it can't be verified from this sandbox,
which has no Postgres to test the workflow against before pushing it.

**Why below item 1/3 originally, now below 5a specifically.** Same reasoning
as the original item 5's ranking: build the CI-wiring cost against a
confirmed need, and now that 5a exists, this is the one remaining concrete
piece rather than a hypothetical.

---

## 6. Make `astk doctor` check schema state, not just reachability

**What to do.** `doctor` currently answers "can I open a socket," which is the easy half of "is this service correctly deployed."

- Add `--expect-tables users,orders` (repeatable/comma-separated) to assert named tables exist via SQLAlchemy `Inspector`, reporting each as a separate check line.
- Detect Alembic: if the consuming repo has an `alembic.ini` or an `alembic_version` table, compare the DB's current revision against the migration head and report `up to date` / `N migrations behind` / `unknown revision`.
- Define and document exit codes so `doctor` is usable as a CI and container healthcheck gate: `0` all checks passed, `1` degraded (reachable but schema or Slack check failed), `2` a hard dependency unreachable.
- Print a compact aligned table of `check / status / detail`, and add `--json` for machine consumption.

**Why sixth.** `doctor` is the highest-leverage surface in the CLI — it's the command a consumer runs first and the one that makes the library feel like infrastructure rather than a grab bag of helpers. Reachability alone gives false confidence: the classic failure is a service that connects fine to a database missing the migration it needs. Ranked here because it's an amplifier of adoption rather than an unblocker of it, and because item 1 will reveal exactly which checks the first consumer actually wants.

---

## 7. Repo hygiene parity with the rest of the portfolio

**What to do.** Bring `astk` up to the standard already set by `btc-llm-sentiment` and `kinz-secure-commerce-hub`:

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `ruff` (lint, `--fix`), `ruff-format`, `bandit -r astk`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `trailing-whitespace`, and `check-yaml`. Pin hook revisions.
- A `bandit` step in the CI workflow, failing on medium severity and above, with a documented allowlist for any intentional finding.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` (dev setup, how to run tests, changelog expectations, the pre-1.0 versioning policy from item 4), `SECURITY.md` (how to report an issue privately), and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

**Why last.** All of it is real and all of it is cheap, but none of it changes whether the library works or whether anyone can adopt it. Bandit on a codebase with no business logic, no auth, and no user input is very unlikely to find anything the test suite wouldn't — the value is consistency across the portfolio, not risk reduction. Doing this before items 1 through 3 would be optimizing the packaging of something that hasn't been proven to work.

---

## 8. `SlackNotifier`'s HTTP-retry-on-exception path has no test   `source: coverage`

`src/astk/alerts.py` is 91% covered; the missing lines are 138-141 — the `except httpx.HTTPError as exc: last_error = ...; self._sleep_if_retrying(attempt); continue` branch inside `SlackNotifier.send()`. Only non-2xx status-code retries are exercised by the test suite; a transport-level exception (connection refused, DNS failure, timeout) has never been tested. This is the code path underpinning CLAUDE.md's stated guarantee that "a broken alert channel must not take down the service using it" — the one contract this module exists to keep. Smaller secondary gaps in the same file: lines 50, 61-62, 64 (`ConsoleNotifier` field printing and `_build_payload`'s `fields`/`link` branches).

Loop-Agent: backlog-refresh / claude / laptop

## 9. `cli.py`: `doctor`'s Slack-config-error path and `query`'s csv/json output are untested   `source: coverage`

`src/astk/cli.py` is 80% covered, the lowest of the actively-used modules. Lines 39-40 — `doctor`'s `except ValueError as exc:` branch when `SlackNotifier(...)` construction fails (e.g. a malformed webhook URL) — and lines 80-87 — the `query` command's `--format json` / `--format csv` branches — have no test coverage. `doctor` is described in the module docstring as "the flagship command," so its failure-reporting path being untested is a real gap in the CLI users run first.

Loop-Agent: backlog-refresh / claude / laptop

---

## Landed 2026-09-02 (toolkit self-audit)

Found while auditing astk from the outside (`ASTK_TOOLKIT_AUDIT.md` in the
workspace); all fixed with tests in one PR. Coverage 91% → 92%.

- **`settings.database_url` accepts SQLite.** Was `PostgresDsn`-only, which
  rejected the `sqlite:///…` URLs every service uses in tests (and that
  `db.make_engine` is built to handle) — forcing each consumer to override the
  field. Now a validated `str`: Postgres URLs still get pydantic's readable
  error, sqlite passes through.
- **Slack severity colour now renders.** `_build_payload` put `blocks` at top
  level with the colour on an empty attachment, so Slack drew no bar. Blocks now
  nest inside the coloured attachment. _(Worth a live-webhook eyeball.)_
- **`db.healthcheck(timeout_s)` is now honoured.** The parameter was dead; a
  hung connect ignored it and blocked. Now bounded on a worker thread
  (`shutdown(wait=False)` so the timeout isn't re-joined away).
- **`SlackNotifier` no longer sleeps after its final attempt** (wasted backoff),
  and gained `close()` + context-manager support so a self-created httpx client
  is cleaned up (a caller-supplied one is left alone).

## Deliberately not on this list

Recorded so this doesn't get re-opened as "missing features" on a later pass. Each is a real gap; none is worth building on spec.

- **Async support (asyncpg / `AsyncSession`).** Every KINZ service today is synchronous. Building a parallel async API doubles the surface area and the test matrix to serve zero current consumers. Revisit when a repo is actually async — item 3's blockers column will surface it.
- **Email / PagerDuty notifiers.** The `Notifier` shape is already established by `SlackNotifier` and `ConsoleNotifier`, so adding one later is a contained change. Add on demand, not in anticipation; a notifier nobody has configured is a notifier nobody has tested against a live endpoint.
- **PyPI release.** The repo is private and all consumers are in the same GitHub org, where pinned git installs (item 4) work fine and leak nothing. Publishing adds a name to squat, a release workflow to maintain, and a public artifact — for no benefit until there's an external consumer.
